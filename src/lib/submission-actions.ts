--------------------------------------------------
üìù Notes for Future Me (Why this is structured this way)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Separation of concerns:
   - Client (form) uploads directly to Cloudinary using an unsigned preset.
   - Server actions here handle *trusted* operations that require secrets:
     - Verifying images exist before saving records.
     - Deleting images when a submission is removed.

2. Why verify with Cloudinary before saving?
   - Prevents fake/malicious data (e.g., someone sending a random URL).
   - Ensures DB only stores images actually hosted in our Cloudinary account.

3. Why store both `secure_url` and `public_id`?
   - `secure_url` ‚Üí needed for frontend display.
   - `public_id` ‚Üí needed for server-side operations like verify/delete.

4. Why delete Cloudinary image first in `deleteSubmission`?
   - Keeps storage clean and avoids "orphaned" images.
   - DB record is only deleted *after* Cloudinary deletion is attempted.

5. Security note:
   - All Cloudinary Admin API calls (verify, destroy) require API key & secret.
   - These must *never* run in client code, only here on the server.

6. `revalidatePath("/")`:
   - Ensures Next.js cache is updated after DB mutations.
   - Keeps UI in sync without manual refresh.
